# Face-Recognization-System-With-Real-Time-Training-And-Recogniztion-using-Opencv-and-LBPH

This project is a **Face Recognition System** that uses the **OpenCV** library to capture and recognize faces through the webcam. It supports adding new faces to the training dataset, training the model, and recognizing faces from the webcam feed in real-time.

## Features

1. **Add New Face**: Allows users to add new faces to the dataset by capturing their face image.
2. **Training**: Trains a **LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram)** face recognizer using collected face images.
3. **Real-time Recognition**: Detects and recognizes faces in real-time through the webcam feed.
4. **Face Detection and Recognition**: Displays the detected face with a bounding box and recognized name along with confidence.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
